## list_my_channels

List channels you are a member of in a team.

Returns your channels with unread counters for the authenticated user.
`unread_msg_count` / `mention_count` count thread replies too (the channel badge with Collapsed Reply Threads off).
`unread_msg_count_root` / `mention_count_root` count only root posts (the badge with Collapsed Reply Threads on).
Use `channel_types` to narrow results.
Use `only_unread` to return only channels with unread messages.
For discovering public channels you haven't joined yet, use list_public_channels.

### Example prompts

- "What channels have unread messages?"
- "Show my private channels"
- "List all my channels in this team"

### Annotations

| Hint | Value |
|------|-------|
| `readOnlyHint` | true |
| `idempotentHint` | true |
| `capability` | read |

### Parameters

| Name | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `team_id` | string | ✓ | — | Team ID (26-character alphanumeric) |
| `channel_types` | array | — | null | Channel types to include: O (public), P (private), D (direct), G (group). Default null returns all types. |
| `only_unread` | boolean | — | false | Return only channels with unread messages. |

### Returns

Array of channel objects with `id`, `name`, `display_name`, `type`, `purpose`,
`total_msg_count`, plus four unread counters for the authenticated user:

- `unread_msg_count` / `mention_count` — non-root semantics: thread replies are
  counted. Match the channel unread badge when Collapsed Reply Threads is off.
- `unread_msg_count_root` / `mention_count_root` — root posts only, excluding
  thread replies. Match the channel unread badge when Collapsed Reply Threads is on.

Channels without a membership record report 0 for all four counters.

## mark_channel_viewed

Mark a channel as viewed for the authenticated user.

Resets the channel-member unread counters (msg_count = total_msg_count,
mention_count = 0) and advances `last_viewed_at` to the current server time.

**When to use:**

- The user explicitly asks to mark a channel as read.
- A bot-monitoring loop where the agent owns the read state for the authenticated
  account, after processing posts fetched via `get_channel_messages(unread_only=true)`.

**Do not call** automatically after fetching unread posts. The user may still rely on
the Mattermost UI unread badge as a "still need to handle" reminder outside of the AI
session.

### Example prompts

- "Mark the engineering channel as read"
- "I've processed everything in #releases — clear the unread badge"

### Annotations

| Hint | Value |
|------|-------|
| `readOnlyHint` | false |
| `destructiveHint` | false |
| `idempotentHint` | false |
| `capability` | write |

Not idempotent: each call advances `last_viewed_at` to the current server time, and any
posts arriving between two consecutive calls are silently marked as viewed by the
second call.

### Parameters

| Name | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `channel_id` | string | ✓ | — | Channel ID (26-character alphanumeric) |

### Returns

None.
